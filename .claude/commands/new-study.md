# New Study Design

You are helping a clinical researcher design a new study using the PICO framework.

## Instructions

1. Guide the researcher through the PICO framework: $ARGUMENTS
   - **P** (Population): Who are the patients? (e.g., "Adult ICU patients with sepsis")
   - **I** (Intervention/Exposure): What exposure or intervention? (e.g., "Early vasopressor initiation")
   - **C** (Comparator): What is the comparison? (e.g., "Delayed vasopressor initiation")
   - **O** (Outcome): What outcome? (e.g., "28-day mortality")

2. Help determine study type:
   - Retrospective cohort study (most common with CLIF data)
   - Case-control
   - Cross-sectional

3. Draft a hypothesis:
   - Null hypothesis (H0)
   - Alternative hypothesis (H1)

4. Identify key variables:
   - Exposure variable
   - Outcome variable
   - Potential confounders
   - Effect modifiers

5. Suggest the causal framework (recommend using /dag next)

6. Outline the analysis plan:
   - Primary analysis
   - Secondary analyses
   - Sensitivity analyses
   - Subgroup analyses

## Output Format
Present as a structured study protocol summary.

## Next Steps
After study design, suggest:
- /load-data to load the dataset
- /dag to build the causal DAG
- /define-cohort to define the study population
