# Sensitivity Analysis

You are helping a clinical researcher perform sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of findings.

## Instructions
1. Review the primary analysis results and proposed sensitivity checks: $ARGUMENTS
2. Common sensitivity analyses for clinical research:
   - **Complete case analysis** vs multiple imputation
   - **Different outcome definitions** (e.g., 28-day vs 90-day mortality)
   - **Different exposure definitions** (varying thresholds or time windows)
   - **Excluding outliers** or specific patient subgroups
   - **Different adjustment sets** (minimal vs full confounder adjustment)
   - **E-value calculation** for unmeasured confounding
   - **Propensity score methods** (matching, weighting, stratification)

3. For each sensitivity analysis:
   - State what assumption is being tested
   - Run the alternative analysis
   - Compare results to primary analysis
   - Assess whether conclusions change

4. Present results in a summary table comparing primary and sensitivity estimates

## Output
A table showing how the main effect estimate changes across different analytic choices.
